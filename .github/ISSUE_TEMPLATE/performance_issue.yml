## ⚡ Performance Problem
<!-- Describe the performance issue you're experiencing -->


## 📊 Metrics & Measurements
<!-- Provide quantitative data about the performance issue -->

- **Latency:** [e.g., p95: 800ms, p99: 1200ms]
- **Throughput:** [e.g., 500 req/s vs expected 3,720 req/s]
- **CPU Usage:** [e.g., 85% avg, spikes to 100%]
- **Memory Usage:** [e.g., 250 MB RSS, growing over time]
- **Queue Depth:** [e.g., consistently at 950/1000 capacity]

## 🔬 Profiling Data
<!-- Attach or paste profiling results -->

- **Tool Used:** [e.g., perf, VTune, gprof, Valgrind]
- **Hot Spots:** [e.g., GatewayCore::consumer_loop taking 45% CPU]
- **Cache Misses:** [e.g., 80% L1 cache miss rate]
