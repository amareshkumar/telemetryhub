# TelemetryHub Custom Configuration Example
# 
# This file demonstrates how to customize TelemetryHub's runtime behavior
# without recompiling. Copy and modify for your deployment.
#
# Usage:
#   gateway_app --config custom_config.ini

# Sampling interval in milliseconds
# Controls how frequently the gateway polls the device for new samples.
# Lower values = higher update rate but more CPU usage
# Higher values = lower CPU usage but slower updates
# Default: 100 (10 Hz)
sampling_interval_ms = 50

# Queue size (bounded capacity)
# Maximum number of telemetry samples stored in the in-memory queue.
# When full, oldest samples are dropped to make room for new ones.
# Set to 0 for unbounded queue (uses more memory under load).
# Recommended: 256-1024 for most deployments
# Default: 0 (unbounded)
queue_size = 512

# Log level: error | warn | info | debug | trace
# Controls verbosity of log output.
# - error: Only critical failures
# - warn:  Warnings and errors
# - info:  Normal operational messages (recommended)
# - debug: Detailed diagnostic information
# - trace: Very verbose, includes function entry/exit
# Default: info
log_level = debug

# Example configurations for different scenarios:

# High-frequency data acquisition (embedded system):
# sampling_interval_ms = 10
# queue_size = 100
# log_level = warn

# Low-power mode (battery-powered device):
# sampling_interval_ms = 1000
# queue_size = 50
# log_level = error

# Development/debugging:
# sampling_interval_ms = 100
# queue_size = 0
# log_level = trace
