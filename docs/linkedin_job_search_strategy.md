## Quick Reference: Best Search Queries

### Search Query 1: Distributed Systems Focus (YOUR PRIMARY TARGET)

```
(C++ OR "C++17" OR "C++20") AND ("distributed systems" OR Redis OR Kafka OR "message queue") AND (Netherlands OR Amsterdam OR Eindhoven OR remote)
```

**Why this works**: Targets C++ backend roles using Redis/Kafka (like your TelemetryTaskProcessor project)

### Search Query 2: Backend Engineering

```
("C++ Engineer" OR "C++ Developer" OR "Software Engineer C++") AND (backend OR "backend systems" OR microservices) AND Netherlands
```

**Why this works**: Standard backend roles that need C++

### Search Query 3: Embedded to Backend Bridge

```
C++ AND (Linux OR "embedded Linux" OR IoT OR "real-time") AND (backend OR distributed OR cloud) AND Netherlands
```

**Why this works**: Bridges your embedded background to backend world

### Search Query 4: Performance/Low-Latency Focus

```
C++ AND ("low latency" OR performance OR "high performance" OR optimization) AND (Amsterdam OR Netherlands)
```

**Why this works**: Matches your performance optimization experience (38% gains)

### Search Query 5: Specific Companies

```
C++ AND (Booking.com OR ASML OR TomTom OR IMC OR Optiver OR Adyen OR "Flow Traders")
```

**Why this works**: Targets known C++ employers in Netherlands

## LinkedIn Job Search Workflow (Daily Routine)

### Morning Routine (20 minutes, 8:00-8:20 AM)

**1. Check Job Alerts** (5 min):
- Open 5 daily alert emails
- Scan subject lines
- Click promising jobs → Save to "Applied" or "Considering" list

**2. Quick Apply** (15 min):
- Pick 2-3 best matches
- Quick apply (if >70% fit)
- Use Easy Apply if available
- Track in spreadsheet

**Goal**: 2-3 applications every morning = 10-15 applications/week

### Afternoon Deep Dive (1 hour, 2x per week - Tuesday & Thursday)

**1. Advanced Search Session** (30 min):
- Use one of the 5 Boolean search queries
- Go through first 50 results
- Save interesting jobs to "Considering"

**2. Company Research** (30 min):
- Pick 2 target companies (Tier 1 or Tier 2)
- Visit careers page directly
- Search for C++ roles
- Read about company culture
- Apply if match found

**Goal**: 3-5 applications from deep research = 6-10 applications/week

### Weekly Total Target

**Daily alerts**: 10-15 applications  
**Deep research**: 6-10 applications  
**Target**: **15-25 applications/week**

**Monthly**: **60-100 applications**

**Why this number**: You already did 200+ applications. Now with updated CV (metrics + DistQueue), quality matters more than quantity. 15-25 GOOD applications/week > 50 random applications.

## LinkedIn Profile Optimization (Do This FIRST)

### Before You Start Applying, Fix These:

**1. Headline** (Current: probably "Senior Software Engineer" - BORING)

**Better Headline**:
```
Senior C++ Engineer | Embedded Systems & Distributed Architecture | C++17/20 | Redis | Fault-Tolerant Design
```

**Why**: Keywords recruiters search for (C++17, Redis, distributed)

**2. About Section** (Use LinkedIn About Natural Version from Earlier)

Copy from: `docs/linkedin_about_natural.md` → Trimmed version (~2450 characters)

**3. Experience Section** (Add Metrics)

For each job, use formula:
```
• [Action] [What] [How] [Result with numbers]
```

Example:
```
• Optimized data processing pipeline: 38% throughput increase (80→110 samples/sec), 35% memory reduction, <10ms p99 latency using cache-friendly data structures
```

**4. Featured Section** (Add Projects)

**Add**:
- TelemetryHub GitHub link: github.com/amareshkumar/telemetryhub
- TelemetryTaskProcessor GitHub link: github.com/amareshkumar/telemetrytaskprocessor (when public)
- Medium article (if you wrote one about TelemetryHub or performance benchmarks)

**5. Skills Section** (Top 50 skills, order matters)

**Order** (recruiters see top 3 first):
1. C++
2. Distributed Systems
3. Redis
4. C++17
5. Linux
6. Multi-threading
7. Performance Optimization
8. Git
9. CMake
10. Docker
... (continue with all relevant skills)

**6. Open to Work** (Turn ON - Green banner)

Settings → Job seeking preferences → Open to work
- ✅ Recruiters only (not public)
- Job titles: "C++ Engineer", "Software Engineer", "Backend Engineer"
- Locations: Netherlands, Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Remote
- Start date: Immediately
- Remote work: On-site, Hybrid, Remote

## Message Template for Recruiters

When recruiter reaches out on LinkedIn:

### Template 1: Interested, Need Details

```
Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thank you for reaching out! I'm interested in C++ backend/distributed systems roles in the Netherlands.

Could you share:
• Job description (tech stack, responsibilities)
• Company name (or industry if confidential)
• Location (Amsterdam, Eindhoven, remote?)
• Salary range (to ensure alignment)
• HSM visa transfer support available?

I have 13 years C++ experience (embedded, backend), modern C++17/20, efficient Redis/Kafka integration, and testing rigor. Currently working on a high-performance task processor in C++ achieving 10,000+ tasks/sec using Redis coordination patterns.

Available for interview next week. Let me know if you'd like to schedule a call.

Best regards,
Amaresh
```

### Template 2: Declining (Wrong Role)

```
Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thank you for considering me! After reviewing the role, I don't think it's a strong fit. The position focuses on [solution architecture / Java / frontend / finance domain], whereas my expertise is in hands-on C++ backend engineering and distributed systems.

I'm looking for roles where I can leverage:
• Modern C++ (C++17/20)
• Distributed systems (Redis, message queues)
• Performance optimization
• Linux backend services

If you have C++ backend engineering roles in the future, I'd be happy to discuss.

Best regards,
Amaresh
```

## Red Flags to Filter Out (Don't Waste Time)

### Job Title Red Flags

❌ **Avoid**:
- "Solution Architect" (we analyzed Alpha Credit - wrong track)
- "Technical Lead" (unless 80%+ coding explicitly stated)
- "Engineering Manager" (management, not coding)
- "Principal Engineer" (very senior, design-heavy, less coding)
- "Staff Engineer" (same as principal)

✅ **Target**:
- "Software Engineer"
- "Senior Software Engineer"
- "C++ Engineer"
- "Backend Engineer"
- "Senior Developer"

### Description Red Flags

❌ **Skip if you see** (in first 2 paragraphs):
- "TOGAF", "ITIL", "Archimate" (enterprise architecture)
- "Dutch (fluent)" + "French (fluent)" (Belgium banking, like Alpha Credit)
- "Stakeholder management", "Liaison", "SPOC" (politics-heavy)
- "SAP", "Salesforce", "CRM", "ERP" (enterprise software, not systems)
- "Mainframe", "COBOL", "AS/400" (legacy banking)
- "5+ years management experience" (you're IC, not manager)

✅ **Look for**:
- "C++17", "C++20", "modern C++"
- "Redis", "Kafka", "RabbitMQ", "message queue"
- "Distributed systems", "microservices", "backend"
- "Performance optimization", "low latency", "high throughput"
- "Linux", "Docker", "Kubernetes"
- "80% coding" or "hands-on" (explicitly stated)

### Company Red Flags

❌ **Be cautious**:
- Consulting firms (Big Water Consulting from Alpha Credit job)
- Body shops (contracting agencies)
- Finance/banking (unless tech-focused like Adyen)
- Startups <10 people (risky with HSM visa)

✅ **Prefer**:
- Tech companies (Booking.com type)
- Product companies (build their own software)
- Scale-ups (50-500 employees, growing)
- Trading firms (IMC, Optiver - very C++ focused)

## Salary Expectations (Netherlands Market - 2025)

### C++ Backend Engineer (13 Years Experience)

**Amsterdam**:
- **Range**: €70,000 - €95,000 per year
- **Your target**: €75,000 - €85,000 (realistic for backend without distributed systems proven experience YET)
- **After DistQueue**: €80,000 - €90,000 (with distributed systems on CV)

**Eindhoven**:
- **Range**: €65,000 - €85,000 per year
- **Your target**: €70,000 - €80,000
- **After DistQueue**: €75,000 - €85,000

**Trading Firms (IMC, Optiver)**:
- **Range**: €80,000 - €120,000 per year (higher because finance)
- **Your target**: €85,000 - €95,000 (if you get in)

### How to Handle Salary Questions

**Recruiter asks**: "What's your salary expectation?"

**Good Answer**:
> "Based on my 13 years C++ experience and the Netherlands market, I'm looking for €75,000-€85,000 for Amsterdam roles (€70,000-€80,000 for Eindhoven). I'm flexible if the role offers strong growth opportunities and interesting technical challenges. What's the range for this position?"

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Realistic range (not too high/low)
- ✅ Shows market research
- ✅ Flexible ("if interesting challenges")
- ✅ Turns question back to them

**If they say "too high"**:
> "I understand. What's the budget for this role? If the technical work is compelling (distributed systems, performance optimization, modern C++), I'm open to discussing within a reasonable range."

**If they say "we can do €X" (within your range)**:
> "That works for me. Let's discuss the role details and technical challenges."
