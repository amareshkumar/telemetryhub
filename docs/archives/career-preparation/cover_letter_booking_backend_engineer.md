RE: Software Engineer I - Backend (Job 16042)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Backend Engineer position at Booking.com. After 13 years building high-performance C++ systems, I'm looking for an opportunity to work on backend services that genuinely impact millions of people—and your mission of making travel easier for everyone resonates with me.

C++ is explicitly listed in your requirements, which is my core strength. I've spent 13 years optimizing performance-critical systems across different domains. Recently, I built TelemetryTaskProcessor (C++17), a backend service processing 10,000+ tasks/sec with sub-5ms p99 latency—8x faster than a Python baseline. It implements Redis-based task distribution with thread-safe queue operations (RPUSH, BLPOP), priority handling, and JSON serialization. This project taught me distributed systems patterns firsthand: message queuing, timeout handling, graceful error recovery, and service-to-service communication.

Your job description mentions "making it work beautifully at scale," which is where I've focused my career. At McAfee (2016-2017), I delivered 38% performance improvements in Factory Runtime Platform through cache-efficient algorithms. At AMD (2013-2015), I squeezed 30% more performance from the Bolt HPC library using OpenCL/OpenMP optimization. At Bosch (2022-2023), I optimized build infrastructure, cutting incremental build time by 25% for a 50-person team. These weren't just isolated wins—they required understanding the entire system, profiling bottlenecks, and iterating until the numbers improved.

I've also built TelemetryHub (C++17/Qt), a REST API-based telemetry system with multithreaded queue management and persistent storage. Working with MySQL/PostgreSQL principles through industrial control systems at McAfee gave me solid database fundamentals: persistent state management, transactional integrity, and proper error handling.

Testing is embedded in my workflow. At Bosch, I implemented a Python TDD framework that reduced regression test time by 40%. For TelemetryTaskProcessor, I wrote 15+ unit tests using GoogleTest before considering features "done." I've seen too many production issues that could've been caught earlier—automated testing isn't optional for me.

What excites me about Booking.com:
- Working at scale that matters (millions of travelers depending on reliable backend services)
- The technical challenges of distributed systems, performance optimization, and infrastructure at your scale
- Collaborating with a diverse team (120+ nationalities) that values pragmatism and experimentation
- Hybrid work model aligns with how I work best

Practical advantages I bring:

First, while many backend engineers focus on Java/Python, my 13 years of C++ brings deep understanding of memory management, concurrency primitives, and low-level optimization that's valuable for performance-critical microservices.

Second, my background spans embedded systems (Bosch, Visteon, McAfee) and backend services (TelemetryTaskProcessor, TelemetryHub). This gives me unique perspective—I understand hardware constraints and API design across the full stack.

Third, I've worked with international teams at Bosch (Germany), Visteon (India/US), McAfee (US/India), and AMD (US). Remote collaboration and asynchronous communication are second nature.

Finally—and critically for this role—I'm based in Eindhoven, Netherlands (HSM visa holder, authorized to work). No relocation support needed. Amsterdam is 1 hour via train, feasible for hybrid work. I can start immediately.

Recent projects available on GitHub:
- TelemetryTaskProcessor (2024): C++17 backend service, Redis integration, 10k tasks/sec
- TelemetryHub (2024): C++17/Qt REST API system, multithreaded architecture

I'd love to discuss how my C++ performance engineering and distributed systems experience can contribute to your team. Particularly curious about the backend challenges you're tackling and how I can help from day one.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Amaresh Kumar

## Match Analysis

**Excellent Fit (85-90%)**:
- ✅ **C++ explicitly listed**: 13 years professional experience
- ✅ **Backend services**: TelemetryTaskProcessor, TelemetryHub demonstrate exactly this
- ✅ **Performance optimization**: 38% McAfee, 30% AMD, 10k tasks/sec TelemetryTaskProcessor
- ✅ **Distributed systems (nice-to-have)**: Redis integration, message queuing, producer-consumer patterns
- ✅ **Databases**: MySQL/PostgreSQL, transaction handling, persistent storage
- ✅ **Testing**: Python TDD, GoogleTest, 40% test time reduction
- ✅ **Git**: Professional Git workflows across all projects
- ✅ **Location**: **Already in Netherlands (Eindhoven)—critical requirement met**
- ✅ **Experience level**: 13 years exceeds 1-3 year requirement (senior candidates welcomed)

**Minor Learning Curve (10-15%)**:
- ⚠️ Java/Perl: Limited experience (but C++ compensates, "one or more server-side languages")
- ⚠️ Kubernetes: Conceptual understanding, limited production experience (Docker familiarity)
- ⚠️ Spring/Hibernate: No direct experience (but REST API patterns understood)

**Recommendation**: **STRONGLY APPLY—PRIORITY TARGET** ⭐

This is an **excellent match** (85-90%). Booking.com explicitly lists C++, emphasizes performance/scalability (your strength), values distributed systems experience (your differentiator), and critically requires "must be in Netherlands" (you are in Eindhoven—no relocation). Your TelemetryTaskProcessor project demonstrates exactly the backend service architecture they need. The 13-year experience exceeds their 1-3 year requirement, which is positive (they state "passion and attitude over years of experience").

**Application Strategy**:
1. **Lead with C++ performance**: Emphasize 13 years + TelemetryTaskProcessor (10k tasks/sec)
2. **Highlight distributed systems advantage**: Redis integration, message queuing (nice-to-have met)
3. **Location advantage**: Already in Netherlands (no relocation)—critical requirement satisfied
4. **Cultural fit**: Mention pragmatism, experimentation, continuous improvement (values alignment)
5. **GitHub portfolio**: Share TelemetryTaskProcessor + TelemetryHub repos to demonstrate code quality
