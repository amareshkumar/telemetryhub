RE: Sensor System Engineer Position

Dear Ms. Dragoumanou,

I'm excited to apply for the Sensor System Engineer position at Kubota. With 13 years developing embedded systems and integrating sensors across automotive and industrial applications, I'm eager to contribute to precision agriculture solutions that address real-world food and environmental challenges.

What caught my attention about this role is the hands-on experimentation aspect. At Bosch (2022-2023), I developed embedded Linux camera software for automotive imaging, integrating STM32 microcontrollers via I²C for sensor calibration with ±2% accuracy improvement. Working directly with optical sensors and embedded hardware taught me how to iterate quickly through testing cycles and troubleshoot integration issues in real-time—exactly what agricultural sensor development demands.

My recent TelemetryTaskProcessor project (C++17) processes 10,000+ tasks/sec with sub-5ms latency, 8x faster than Python baseline. While it's not agriculture-specific, it demonstrates my approach to data processing pipelines that could analyze sensor behavior efficiently. At McAfee, I delivered 38% performance improvements in industrial control system data processing through algorithmic optimization.

I've also navigated the stakeholder communication and cross-functional collaboration this role requires. At Visteon (2018-2019), I worked on automotive HMI delivered to three OEMs (VW, Renault, Nissan), which meant constantly aligning specifications across international teams and managing external partner relationships. I learned that clear technical communication often matters as much as the technical work itself.

Honestly, I'm new to spectroscopy and agriculture-specific sensing, but that's part of what attracts me to this opportunity. My background is automotive and industrial embedded systems, yet the core skills transfer: sensor integration in harsh environments, real-time data processing, safety-critical systems (IEC 62443 certified), and systematic experimentation. I've built my career on quickly mastering new technical domains when given the chance.

Kubota's mission to solve problems in food, water, and environment through sensor innovation resonates deeply with me. Contributing to precision agriculture that directly enhances global food production feels more meaningful than another automotive project.

Practical details: I'm based in Eindhoven (easily commutable to Nieuw-Vennep), hold an HSM visa (no sponsorship needed), and can start immediately.

I'd love to discuss how my embedded systems experience and passion for hands-on problem-solving can contribute to your sensor suite development. Particularly excited to learn more about your field deployment process and how you're tackling the agricultural sensing challenges.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Amaresh Kumar
