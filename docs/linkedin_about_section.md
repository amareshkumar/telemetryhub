## Version 1: Balanced Professional (Recommended)

I'm a senior C++ systems engineer with 13 years building production software across embedded systems, desktop applications, and backend services. Currently based in Eindhoven (Netherlands) with immediate availability and HSM transfer-ready status.

**What I do:**  
I design and implement performance-critical C++ systems where reliability isn't optional—automotive (ISO 26262), medical devices (IEC 62304), and industrial IoT (IEC 62443). My work spans the full stack: embedded Linux firmware, REST API backends, Qt/QML desktop applications, and everything in between.

**What makes me different:**  
Most engineers specialize in one domain. I bridge three: resource-constrained embedded systems, high-performance backend services, and responsive desktop applications. This versatility means I can architect solutions that balance hardware constraints, performance requirements, and user experience—all while maintaining safety standards and testing rigor.

**Recent highlights:**  
• Built TelemetryHub: A production-grade embedded telemetry gateway demonstrating fault tolerance patterns (circuit breaker, bounded queues), comprehensive testing with fault injection framework, and modern C++17 practices. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/amareshkumar/telemetryhub)  
• Achieved 40% faster build times at Bosch through CMake optimization and TDD introduction  
• Delivered 38% performance improvement at McAfee on security-critical file encryption  
• Led cross-functional teams integrating Qt/C++ backends with Chromium V8 for automotive infotainment (Visteon/Jaguar Land Rover)

**Technical depth:**  
Modern C++14/17/20/23 • Multi-threading & concurrency patterns • Safety-critical systems (IEC 62304, ISO 26262, IEC 62443) • Performance profiling & optimization • REST API design • Embedded Linux (Yocto, STM32) • Qt/QML • Python for testing & automation • CMake/CI-CD • Docker

**What I'm looking for:**  
Senior C++ roles where architecture decisions matter, testing is non-negotiable, and systems thinking is valued. I thrive in environments that balance technical excellence with pragmatic delivery—whether that's embedded systems, backend infrastructure, or desktop applications.

Open to permanent positions (36-40 hours/week) anywhere in the Netherlands. HSM permit holder—only sponsorship transfer required for immediate start.

**Let's connect** if you're building systems where performance, reliability, and code quality aren't just buzzwords—they're requirements.

## Version 2: More Technical Focus

**Senior C++ Systems Engineer | Embedded • Backend • Desktop | Safety-Critical Systems Specialist**

13 years building production C++ systems across three domains most engineers never bridge: embedded firmware, backend services, and desktop applications. Currently based in Eindhoven with HSM permit (transfer-ready, immediate availability).

**The intersection where I work:**  
I design systems where C++ is the only reasonable choice—performance-critical, resource-constrained, safety-certified environments. Medical devices measuring blood samples. Automotive infotainment systems running in vehicles. Industrial IoT controlling greenhouses. Security software encrypting enterprise data.

**What this looks like in practice:**

*Architecture:* Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance. Bounded queues for backpressure handling. Thread pools for concurrency. State machines for reliability. Hardware abstraction layers for portability.

*Testing:* Comprehensive strategies—unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end validation, and fault injection frameworks. Because in safety-critical systems, "it works on my machine" isn't acceptable.

*Performance:* Profiling-driven optimization. 38% performance gain at McAfee through algorithmic improvements. 40% faster builds at Bosch through CMake restructuring. Real numbers, not buzzwords.

*Standards:* IEC 62304 (medical devices), ISO 26262/21434 (automotive), IEC 62443 (industrial IoT), MISRA C++. I understand the "why" behind the rules, not just the compliance checkbox.

**Current portfolio work:**  
Building TelemetryHub—a production-grade embedded gateway with multi-threaded architecture, REST API, fault tolerance patterns, and comprehensive testing. Modern C++17, clean architecture, full CI/CD. Because at 13 years experience, showing beats claiming. [GitHub](https://github.com/amareshkumar/telemetryhub)

**Technical stack:**  
C++14/17/20/23 (RAII, move semantics, perfect forwarding, constexpr) • Qt/QML • Embedded Linux (Yocto, Device Tree, I²C/UART/SPI) • REST APIs (Poco) • Python (pytest, tooling) • CMake/CTest • GTest/GMock • Git/CI-CD (GitHub Actions) • Docker • Performance tools (perf, uProf, valgrind)

**What I'm seeking:**  
Senior roles (IC track, not management) where:
- Architecture decisions balance trade-offs (not just "move fast and break things")
- Testing is engineering discipline, not afterthought
- Performance matters (low latency, high throughput, or resource constraints)
- Code quality is shared value, not individual preference

**Location:** Netherlands (willing to relocate within NL)  
**Availability:** Immediate (HSM transfer-ready)  
**Work arrangement:** Permanent, 36-40 hrs/week

Reach out if you're building systems where "good enough" isn't—let's talk about where engineering rigor meets pragmatic delivery.

## Version 3: Storytelling Approach (More Personal)

I still remember the first time I saw a medical device crash during a live demonstration because of a null pointer dereference. That was 2023, and it crystallized why I do what I do: in the systems I build, software failures aren't just bugs—they're risks to safety, security, and trust.

**Who I am:**  
I'm Amaresh, a senior C++ systems engineer with 13 years building software where reliability isn't optional. Currently based in Eindhoven (Netherlands), working across embedded systems, backend services, and desktop applications.

**The problems I solve:**  
Most of my career has been in domains where "we'll fix it in production" isn't an option:
- Automotive systems (ISO 26262) where software updates can't be weekly patches
- Medical devices (IEC 62304) where failures impact patient diagnostics  
- Industrial IoT (IEC 62443) where downtime costs thousands per hour
- Security software where performance and correctness both matter

**What makes this interesting:**  
C++ is experiencing a renaissance. While many chase the latest framework, companies are rediscovering that when you need performance, control, and reliability—C++ with modern practices (C++17/20/23) is still unbeatable. The challenge isn't just writing C++; it's writing *maintainable*, *safe*, *testable* C++ in environments with real constraints.

**Recent work I'm proud of:**  
• TelemetryHub: Built an embedded telemetry gateway from scratch—multi-threaded architecture, circuit breaker for fault tolerance, bounded queues for backpressure, comprehensive fault injection testing. Modern C++17, clean architecture, full CI/CD. It's on GitHub because at 13 years, showing beats claiming.

• Bosch Camera Pipeline: Introduced TDD practices to a large C/C++ codebase. Result: 40% faster builds through CMake optimization, shorter test cycles, better defect detection. The team was skeptical at first—by the end, they were advocates.

• McAfee Encryption: Performance-critical work on endpoint security software. Delivered 38% throughput improvement through algorithmic optimization and profiling-driven development.

**The technical side:**  
Modern C++14/17/20/23 • Multi-threading (thread pools, lock-free queues) • Embedded Linux (Yocto, device drivers, I²C/UART/SPI) • Qt/QML for desktop • REST APIs • Python for testing • Safety standards (IEC 62304, ISO 26262, IEC 62443) • Performance profiling • Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, fault injection)

**What I'm looking for:**  
Senior C++ roles where:
- Engineering rigor is valued, not bureaucracy  
- Testing is part of definition of done
- Performance matters (whether that's low latency, high throughput, or resource constraints)
- Architecture balances trade-offs, not just "best practices"

I'm drawn to teams that ship production systems—not just MVPs, but systems that run reliably for years. Backend infrastructure, embedded systems, desktop applications—if it requires C++ expertise and systems thinking, I'm interested.

**Logistics:**
