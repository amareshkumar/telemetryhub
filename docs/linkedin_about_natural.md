I'm a senior C++ systems engineer with 13 years building production software across embedded systems, backend services, and desktop applications. Currently based in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with immediate availability and HSM transfer-ready status.

My career has taken me through three domains that most engineers rarely bridge: resource-constrained embedded systems where every byte matters, high-performance backend services where latency is measured in milliseconds, and desktop applications where user experience can't be sacrificed for performance. This versatility means I understand the full stack, from hardware constraints and real-time requirements to API design and user interface responsiveness.

What drives my work is building systems where reliability isn't optional. I've spent years in safety-critical environments: automotive systems following ISO 26262, medical devices under IEC 62304, and industrial IoT adhering to IEC 62443. In these domains, "we'll fix it in production" isn't an option. The software has to work, has to be testable, and has to be maintainable by teams that come after you.

I'm particularly proud of a few recent projects. At Bosch, I introduced TDD practices to a large embedded C/C++ codebase and restructured the build system with CMake, which resulted in 40% faster build times. At McAfee, I worked on performance-critical encryption software and delivered a 38% throughput improvement through profiling-driven optimization. More recently, I built TelemetryHub, an embedded telemetry gateway from scratch with modern C++17, demonstrating fault tolerance patterns like circuit breakers and bounded queues, comprehensive testing including fault injection, and clean architecture principles. The project is on GitHub because at 13 years experience, showing beats claiming.

My technical background spans modern C++14/17/20/23 with all the idioms that make it actually maintainable (RAII, move semantics, smart pointers), along with Qt/QML for desktop applications, Python for testing and automation, embedded Linux including Yocto and device drivers, REST API design, and comprehensive testing practices. I'm comfortable with CMake build systems, CI/CD pipelines, Docker containerization, and performance profiling tools.

What I'm looking for now are senior C++ roles where architecture decisions balance real trade-offs, not just textbook "best practices." I thrive in environments where testing is an engineering discipline, where performance matters whether that's low latency, high throughput, or resource constraints, and where code quality is a shared team value rather than one person's crusade. I'm drawn to backend infrastructure, embedded systems, and desktop applications, basically anywhere that requires C++ expertise and systems thinking.

I'm open to permanent positions at 36 to 40 hours per week, willing to relocate anywhere in the Netherlands. As an HSM permit holder, I only need sponsorship transfer for immediate start, no visa delays.

If you're building systems where engineering rigor meets pragmatic delivery, where "good enough" isn't good enough, I'd love to hear about them. Feel free to reach out at amaresh.kumar@live.in or +31 645 302 309. You can also check out my work on GitHub at github.com/amareshkumar/telemetryhub.

## Alternative Version - Slightly More Personal

I've been writing C++ professionally for 13 years, and I still find it fascinating how much the language and its ecosystem have evolved. When I started, C++11 was the new hotness. Now we have C++17, 20, 23, and the landscape has completely changed. Modern C++ with proper practices isn't the memory-management minefield people remember from the 90s. It's elegant, powerful, and when you need performance and control, still unbeatable.

I'm based in Eindhoven, Netherlands, working as a senior systems engineer across three domains: embedded systems, backend services, and desktop applications. Most of my career has been in environments where software failures have real consequences. Automotive infotainment systems where updates can't be weekly patches. Medical devices where crashes affect patient diagnostics. Industrial IoT where downtime costs thousands per hour. Security software where both performance and correctness matter.

These experiences shaped how I approach engineering. I care deeply about testing, not because some methodology says I should, but because I've seen what happens when you don't. I think about architecture, not to follow SOLID principles religiously, but because I've maintained codebases where nobody thought about architecture. I profile before optimizing, because I've wasted time optimizing the wrong things.

Some work I'm particularly proud of: at Bosch, I introduced TDD to a skeptical team and restructured the build system, resulting in 40% faster builds and better defect detection. At McAfee, I worked on performance-critical encryption software and delivered 38% throughput improvement. Recently, I built TelemetryHub, an embedded telemetry gateway demonstrating modern C++17, fault tolerance patterns, and comprehensive testing. It's on GitHub because at this stage of my career, I'd rather show than claim.

My technical stack includes modern C++14/17/20/23, Qt/QML for desktop work, Python for testing and tooling, embedded Linux with Yocto and device drivers, REST API design, and the whole modern development ecosystem of CMake, Git, CI/CD, Docker, and profiling tools. I'm comfortable with safety standards like IEC 62304, ISO 26262, and IEC 62443, not just checking compliance boxes but understanding the engineering reasoning behind them.

What I'm looking for are senior C++ roles, individual contributor track, where the team values engineering rigor but knows when to be pragmatic. Backend infrastructure, embedded systems, desktop applications, I'm interested if it requires systems thinking and the work matters. I'm open to permanent positions at 36 to 40 hours per week and willing to relocate anywhere in the Netherlands. As an HSM permit holder, I only need sponsorship transfer for immediate start.

If this resonates and you're working on interesting problems with C++, I'd enjoy hearing about them. You can reach me at amaresh.kumar@live.in or +31 645 302 309, and my work is on GitHub at github.com/amareshkumar/telemetryhub.

## Alternative Version - Direct and Conversational

Senior C++ systems engineer, 13 years experience, currently in Eindhoven with immediate availability.

I build software where reliability matters. Most of my career has been in safety-critical domains: automotive systems under ISO 26262, medical devices following IEC 62304, industrial IoT with IEC 62443. These aren't environments where you ship fast and fix in production. The code has to work, has to be testable, and has to be maintainable.

What makes my background unusual is the breadth. I've worked across embedded systems where you count bytes, backend services where you measure latency in milliseconds, and desktop applications where user experience matters as much as performance. This means I understand trade-offs across the full stack, from hardware constraints to API design to UI responsiveness.

Recent work includes restructuring build systems at Bosch for 40% faster builds, performance optimization at McAfee delivering 38% throughput improvement, and building TelemetryHub, an embedded gateway with modern C++17, fault tolerance patterns, and comprehensive testing. The project is on GitHub because at 13 years, showing beats claiming.

Technical capabilities cover modern C++14/17/20/23, Qt/QML, Python, embedded Linux, REST APIs, CMake, CI/CD, Docker, and performance profiling. Comfortable with safety standards and understanding the engineering reasoning behind them, not just compliance.

Looking for senior C++ roles on the individual contributor track where architecture, testing, and performance aren't negotiable. Backend infrastructure, embedded systems, or desktop applications, anywhere that requires systems thinking and where the work matters. Open to permanent positions, 36 to 40 hours per week, anywhere in the Netherlands. HSM permit holder, so only sponsorship transfer needed for immediate start.

If you're building reliable systems and value engineering rigor, let's talk. Reach me at amaresh.kumar@live.in or +31 645 302 309. Work samples at github.com/amareshkumar/telemetryhub.
